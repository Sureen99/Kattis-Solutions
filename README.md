# Kattis-Solutions
A place for solutions to some Kattis problems that i attempted

The solutions in python are mostly for beginner level super basic problems that i attempted a while back and just decided to copy over
The solutions in java will contain more of the higher level problems that require more complex data structures and algorithms

Hope you find them useful! If unsure of anything or if need more clarifications on something pls telegram @Gitaxis. I will try to help as much as I can
if my schedule permits it
